We use this framework to measure the contribution of mismatch to the recent rise in US unemployment by exploiting two sources of cross-sectional data on vacancies, JOLTS and HWOL. Our calculations indicate that mismatch, across industries and three-digit occupations, explains at most one-third of the total observed increase in the unemployment rate. Occupational mismatch has become especially more severe for college graduates, and in the West of the United States. Geographical mismatch unemployment plays no apparent role.

This paper disentangles these two components and studies their eﬀect on the economy using a structural vector autoregression.

Building on these results, I characterize (i) the correct deﬁnition of aggregate inﬂation and (ii) how the optimal policy trades oﬀ inﬂation in diﬀerent sectors, based on the production structure. I construct two novel inﬂation indicators. The ﬁrst yields a well-speciﬁed Phillips curve. Consistent with the theory, this index provides a better ﬁt in Phillips curve regressions than conventional speciﬁcations with consumer prices. The second is an optimal policy target, which captures the tradeoﬀ between stabilizing aggregate output and relative output across sectors. Calibrating the model to the U.S. economy I ﬁnd that targeting consumer inﬂation generates a welfare loss of 0.8\% of per-period GDP relative to the optimal policy, while targeting the output gap is close to optimal.},

	abstract = {We provide a nonlinear characterization of the macroeconomic impact of microeconomic productivity shocks in terms of reduced-form non-parametric elasticities for eﬃcient economies. We also show how microeconomic parameters are mapped to these reduced-form general equilibrium elasticities. In this sense, we extend the foundational theorem of Hulten (1978) beyond the ﬁrst order to capture nonlinearities. Key features ignored by ﬁrst-order approximations that play a crucial role are: structural microeconomic elasticities of substitution, network linkages, structural microeconomic returns to scale, and the extent of factor reallocation. In a business-cycle calibration with sectoral shocks, nonlinearities magnify negative shocks and attenuate positive shocks, resulting in an aggregate output distribution that is asymmetric (negative skewness), fat-tailed (excess kurtosis), and a has negative mean, even when shocks are symmetric and thintailed. Average output losses due to short-run sectoral shocks are an order of magnitude larger than the welfare cost of business cycles calculated by Lucas (1987). Nonlinearities can also cause shocks to critical sectors to have disproportionate macroeconomic eﬀects, almost tripling the estimated impact of the 1970s oil shocks on world aggregate output. Finally, in a long-run growth context, nonlinearities, which underpin Baumol’s cost disease via the increase over time in the sales shares of low-growth bottleneck sectors, account for a 20 percentage point reduction in aggregate TFP growth over the period 1948-2014 in the US.},

We allow for arbitrary elasticities of substitution, returns to scale, factor mobility, and input-output network linkages. We show how to separately measure changes in technical and allocative eﬃciency. We also show how to compute the social cost of distortions. We pursue applications focusing on ﬁrm-level markups in the U.S. We ﬁnd that improvement in allocative eﬃciency, due to the reallocation over time of market share to high-markup ﬁrms, accounts for about half of aggregate TFP growth over the period 1997-2015. We also ﬁnd that eliminating the misallocation resulting from the large and dispersed markups estimated in the data would raise aggregate TFP by about 15\%, increasing the economy-wide cost of monopoly distortions by two orders of magnitude compared to the famous 0.1\% estimate by Harberger (1954). These exact numbers should be interpreted with care since the data is imperfect and requires substantial imputation.},

We then characterize the optimal policy in terms of the economy’s production network and the extent and nature of nominal rigidities. Our characterization result yields general principles for the optimal conduct of monetary policy in the presence of input-output linkages: it establishes that optimal policy stabilizes a price index with higher weights assigned to larger, stickier, and more upstream industries, as well as industries with less sticky upstream suppliers but stickier downstream customers.

We find that the credit expansion led to an increase in the skill intensity of firms and in within-firm returns to skill and to a reallocation of skilled labor from financially unconstrained firms to constrained firms. To rationalize these findings, we design a model in which heterogeneous producers face constraints in their ability to borrow and have production functions featuring capital-skill complementarity. We use this framework to generate an industry-level measure of capital-skill complementarity, which we use to provide direct evidence that the effect of access to credit on skill utilization and the skill premium is driven by a relative complementarity between capital and skilled labor.},

In recessions, job rationing is acute, driving the rise in unemployment, whereas matching frictions contribute little to unemployment. Intuitively in recessions, jobs are lacking, the labor market is slack, and recruiting is easy and inexpensive, so matching frictions do not matter much.

The interaction of input-output networks with industry-level market structure affects the amplification of shocks and the pattern of diffusion in the model, generating cascades of firm entry and exit across the economy. In this model, sales provide a poor measure of the systemic importance of industries. Unlike the relevant notions of centrality in competitive constant-returns-to-scale models, systemic importance depends on the industry's role as both a supplier and a consumer of inputs, as well as the market structure of industries. A basic calibration of the model suggests that aggregate output is three times more volatile in response to labor productivity shocks when compared to a perfectly competitive model.},

	abstract = {This paper develops a sufficient-statistic formula for the unemployment gap—the difference between the actual unemployment rate and the efficient unemployment rate. While lowering unemployment puts more people into work, it forces firms to post more vacancies and to devote more resources to recruiting. This unemployment-vacancy tradeoff, governed by the Beveridge curve, determines the efficient unemployment rate. Accordingly, the unemployment gap can be measured from three sufficient statistics: elasticity of the Beveridge curve, social cost of unemployment, and cost of recruiting. Applying this formula to the United States, 1951–2019, we find that the efficient unemployment rate averages 4.3\%, always remains between 3.0\% and 5.4\%, and has been stable between 3.8\% and 4.6\% since 1990. As a result, the unemployment gap is countercyclical, reaching 6 percentage points in slumps. The US labor market is therefore generally inefficient and especially inefficiently slack in slumps. In turn, the unemployment gap is a crucial statistic to design labor-market and macroeconomic policies.},

We show that, as the economy becomes more disaggregated, the rate at which aggregate volatility decays is determined by the structure of the network capturing such linkages. Our main results provide a characterization of this relationship in terms of the importance of different sectors as suppliers to their immediate customers, as well as their role as indirect suppliers to chains of downstream sectors. Such higher-order interconnections capture the possibility of “cascade effects” whereby productivity shocks to a sector propagate not only to its immediate downstream customers, but also to the rest of the economy. Our results highlight that sizable aggregate volatility is obtained from sectoral idiosyncratic shocks only if there exists significant asymmetry in the roles that sectors play as suppliers to others, and that the “sparseness” of the input–output matrix is unrelated to the nature of aggregate fluctuations.},

	abstract = {We develop a tractable model of endogenous production networks. Each one of a number of products can be produced by combining labor and an endogenous subset of the other products as inputs. Different combinations of inputs generate (prespecified) levels of productivity and various distortions may affect costs and prices. We establish the existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium and provide comparative static results on how prices and endogenous technology/input choices (and thus the production network) respond to changes in parameters. These results show that improvements in technology (or reductions in distortions) spread throughout the economy via input–output linkages and reduce all prices, and under reasonable restrictions on the menu of production technologies, also lead to a denser production network. Using a dynamic version of the model, we establish that the endogenous evolution of the production network could be a powerful force towards sustained economic growth. At the root of this result is the fact that the arrival of a few new products expands the set of technological possibilities of all existing industries by a large amount—that is, if there are n products, the arrival of one more new product increases the combinations of inputs that each existing product can use from 2n−1 to 2n, thus enabling significantly more pronounced cost reductions from choice of input combinations. These cost reductions then spread to other industries via lower input prices and incentivize them to also adopt additional inputs.},

We discuss the determinants of aggregate measures of real economic activity, like real GDP, real domestic absorption, and aggregate productivity in both efficient and inefficient environments. We also discuss how shocks from one set of producers are transmitted to other producers through prices and quantities. The framework we provide is amenable to generalization and can be used to study any collection of producers ranging from one isolated producer, to an industry consisting of heterogeneous producers, to an entire economy. We conclude with a brief survey of some of the applied questions that can be addressed using the analytical tools presented in this review and avenues for future work.},

I embed the ﬁrm model into a general equilibrium framework that endogenizes the dynamic choice for workers to switch occupations in response to robots. To this end, I develop a ﬁxed-point algorithm for solving the general equilibrium that features two-sided (ﬁrm and worker) heterogeneity and dynamics. I estimate that robots have increased average real wages by 0.8 percent but have lowered the real wages of production workers by 5.4 percent. Welfare losses from robots are concentrated on old production workers, as younger workers beneﬁt from the option value of switching into tech.},

We study these questions in a model with input-output linkages, regional structure, and household heterogeneity in MPCs, consumption baskets, and shock exposures. Theoretically, we derive estimable formulae for the eﬀects of ﬁscal policies on aggregate GDP, or ﬁscal multipliers, and show how network structures determine their size. Empirically, we ﬁnd that multipliers vary substantially across policies, so targeting is important. Beneath these aggregate eﬀects are large spatial and sectoral spillovers from policies directed to any one ﬁrm or household. However, virtually all variation in multipliers stems from diﬀerences in policies’ direct incidence onto households’ MPCs. Thus, while the distributional eﬀects of ﬁscal policy depend on the detailed structure of the economy, maximally expansionary ﬁscal policy simply targets households’ MPCs.},

Employer-employee data, matched with the universe of ﬁrm-to-ﬁrm transactions for the Dominican Republic, reveals that one ﬁfth of workers who change ﬁrm move to a buyer or supplier of their original employer—signiﬁcantly more than predicted by standard labor market characteristics. Hiring from buyers or suppliers accounts for the majority of net job ﬂows to higher wage and productivity ﬁrms. An event-study shows that moving to a buyer or supplier results in a persistent 6.7 p.p. increase in earnings relative to other movers. One third of this premium is due to supply chain movers earning more than other workers hired at the same ﬁrm. The ﬁndings are rationalized with a simple model of on-the-job search in which workers are more likely to ﬁnd out about job opportunities at buyers and suppliers, and form more productive matches with these ﬁrms. We present evidence that this higher match quality can be explained by human capital transferability along the supply chain. Our results point to a new channel through which factors affecting the supply chain, such as international outsourcing or contracting frictions, affect labor market dynamism.},

	abstract = {We study a two-country, two-sector model of international trade in which one sector produces homogeneous products and the other produces differentiated products. Both sectors are subjected to search and matching frictions in the labour market and wage bargaining. As a result, some of the workers searching for jobs end up being unemployed. Countries are similar except for frictions in their labour markets, such as efficiency of matching and costs of posting vacancies, which can vary across the sectors. The differentiated-product industry has firm heterogeneity and monopolistic competition. We study the interaction of labour market rigidities and trade impediments in shaping welfare, trade flows, productivity, and unemployment. We show that both countries gain from trade. A country with relatively lower frictions in the differentiated-product industry exports differentiated products on net. A country benefits from lowering frictions in its differentiated sector's labour market, but this harms the country's trade partner. Alternatively, a simultaneous, proportional lowering of labour market frictions in the differentiated sectors of both countries benefits both of them. The opening to trade raises a country's rate of unemployment if its relative labour market frictions in the differentiated sector are low, and it reduces the rate of unemployment if its relative labour market frictions in the differentiated sector are high. Cross-country differences in rates of unemployment exhibit rich patterns. In particular, lower labour market frictions do not ensure lower unemployment, and unemployment and welfare can both rise in response to falling labour market frictions and falling trade costs.},

Using a simple model of local labor markets with mobility costs, we find that common conclusions drawn from migration regression estimates are likely to be substantially misleading. Intuitively, the conventional migration regression is misspecified due to the bilateral nature of location choices. Workers choose where to live based not only on the shock to their current location, but also on the shocks to potential alternative locations, which are omitted from the regression. Analytical results and simulations based on Brazilian data show that conventional migration regression estimates are inaccurate for the local population effects of either shocks to individual locations or all observed shocks taken together. These problems are particularly acute when workers face industry switching costs in addition to geographic mobility costs. A simple alternative approach leveraging the model’s structure exhibits far better performance.},

We then develop a reduced-form representation of spatial models in which changes in regional outcomes combine (i) each region’s ‘‘shift-share’’ exposure to shocks in its excess labor demand, and (ii) the reduced-form effect that this exposure has directly on that region, and indirectly on other regions through spatial links. We use this representation to uncover the roots of the disconnect, and derive an empirical specification whose aggregation yields the shock’s general equilibrium impact. Finally, estimates of our reduced-form representation for the China shock yield large direct effects and reinforcing indirect effects, which arise from strong agglomeration forces, strong (weak) employment sensitivity to wages (prices), and regional production and trade links. As a result, we obtain employment losses that are larger and more dispersed than those implied by existing quantitative frameworks.},

However, as labor markets overlap, a local stimulus or transport improvements have modest effects on local outcomes, because ripple effects in job applications dilute their impact across a series of overlapping markets.

	abstract = {Which factors determine the size and shape of labor markets? Large parts of the current literature in labor economics rely on a geographically determined deﬁnition of local labor markets. In this paper, I introduce a novel method to identify endogenous labor markets which are revealed by job mobility ﬂows rather than pre-deﬁned administrative boundaries. In particular, I decompose a large job mobility network that is generated by the universe of job-to-job transitions in the economy into separate markets. The estimation is based on the stochastic block model (SBM) from the literature on network analysis and micro-founded by a simple ﬁrm choice model. Firms are in the same labor market if they have similar links to other ﬁrms and not because they are located in the same region. In an extensive descriptive analysis, I compare endogenous markets to geographically separated markets. Based on the novel concept, I analyze employment spillovers following a large local labor demand shock as well as mobility responses to import competition from China and Eastern Europe. My results show that endogenous labor markets are better suited to explain and predict adjustments to both local and global shocks than local areas.},

This paper implements a novel method based on complex network analysis to describe how workers move from job to job. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), I ﬁnd ﬁrst that the labor market is composed of four distinct segments between which job mobility is relatively unlikely. Second, these segments are not well-described on the basis of industry, occupation, demographic characteristics, or education. Third, mobility segments are associated with earnings heterogeneity, and there is evidence of positive assortative matching across segments. Fourth, the boundaries to job mobility are counter-cyclical: workers move more freely when unemployment is low.},

            How does an economy’s production structure determine its macroeconomic response to sectoral distortions? We study a static, multisector framework in which production is organized in an input-output network and production decisions are distorted. Sectoral distortions manifest at the aggregate level via two channels: total factor productivity (TFP) and the labor wedge. We show that near efficiency, distortions have zero first-order effects on TFP and nonzero first-order effects on the labor wedge, and that a sufficient statistic for the latter are the Domar weights. We thereby provide a Hulten-like theorem for the aggregate effects of sectoral distortions. A quantitative application of the model to the 2008–09 financial crisis suggests that the U.S. input-output structure amplified financial distortions by roughly a factor of two during the crisis.},

I analyze industrial policy when economic sectors form a production network via input-output linkages. Market imperfections generate distortionary effects that compound through backward demand linkages, causing upstream sectors to become the sink for imperfections and have the greatest size distortions. My key ﬁnding is that the distortion in sectoral size is a sufﬁcient statistic for the social value of promoting that sector; thus, there is an incentive for a well-meaning government to subsidize upstream sectors. Furthermore, sectoral interventions’ aggregate effects can be simply summarized, to ﬁrst order, by the cross-sector covariance between my sufﬁcient statistic and subsidy spending. My sufﬁcient statistic predicts sectoral policies in South Korea in the 1970s and modern-day China, suggesting that sectoral interventions might have generated positive aggregate effects in these economies.},

	abstract = {How much and how quickly do supply chains transmit commodity price movements into inflation? We study this question theoretically and empirically, demonstrating that commodity price movements propagate gradually to prices throughout the economy and generate lasting effects on inflation. First, we set up a dynamic supply-side pricing model featuring a production network and Calvo pricing. We show theoretically that commodity price movements pass through fully but much more gradually to firms using the commodity indirectly through their supply chains, even if they are forward-looking about how their suppliers’ prices will react in the future. Second, we confirm these theoretical results empirically and show robustness to a variety of identification strategies. Third, we structurally estimate the model, explaining these findings as a combination of heterogeneity in firms’ frequencies of price adjustment and slow propagation to indirect users resulting from the presence of a production network. We find that indirect users are less forward-looking about input cost changes resulting from non-oil commodity price movements, slowing down pass-through relative to oil price movements. Finally, we demonstrate how practitioners can use our model to measure the component of aggregate inflation induced by supply chain effects of oil price movements. These effects take years to manifest fully (1 year to reach 75\%), are twice as large as the direct effect on consumer gasoline prices, and account for 15\% of the monthly variation in core PCE inflation. Removing all of oil’s effects in the current inflationary episode reduces measured year-over-year PCE inflation to a peak of 5\%.},

What emerges is a tractable relation for wage dynamics that is a natural generalization of the period‐by‐period Nash bargaining outcome in the conventional formulation. We then show that a reasonable calibration of the model can account for the cyclical behavior of wages and labor market activity observed in the data.},

Simultaneously, it has challenged much of the received empirical wisdom about how labor markets adjust to trade shocks. Alongside the heralded consumer benefits of expanded trade are substantial adjustment costs and distributional consequences. These impacts are most visible in the local labor markets in which the industries exposed to foreign competition are concentrated. Adjustment in local labor markets is remarkably slow, with wages and labor-force participation rates remaining depressed and unemployment rates remaining elevated for at least a full decade after the China trade shock commences. Exposed workers experience greater job churning and reduced lifetime income. At the national level, employment has fallen in U.S. industries more exposed to import competition, as expected, but offsetting employment gains in other industries have yet to materialize. Better understanding when and where trade is costly, and how and why it may be beneficial, are key items on the research agenda for trade and labor economists.},

A model of matching friction explains the qualitative responses of the labor market to adverse shocks, but requires implausibly large shocks to account for the magnitude of observed fluctuations. The incorporation of wage stickiness vastly increases the sensitivity of the model to driving forces. I develop a new model of the way that wage stickiness affects unemployment. The stickiness arises in an economic equilibrium and satisfies the condition that no worker-employer pair has an unexploited opportunity for mutual improvement. Sticky wages neither interfere with the efficient formation of employment matches nor cause inefficient job loss. Thus the model provides an answer to the fundamental criticism previously directed as sticky-wage models of fluctuations. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

In the United States, the standard deviation of the vacancy-unemployment ratio is almost 20 times as large as the standard deviation of average labor productivity, while the search model predicts that the two variables should have nearly the same volatility. A shock that changes average labor productivity primarily alters the present value of wages, generating only a small movement along a downward-sloping Beveridge curve (unemployment-vacancy locus). A shock to the seperation rate generates a counterfactually positive correlation between unemployment and vacancies. In both cases, the model exhibits virtually no propagation.
