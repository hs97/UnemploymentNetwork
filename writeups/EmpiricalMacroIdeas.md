# Research Ideas for Empirical Macro

This markdown contains a list of ideas for the final project for empirical macro.

1. Estimating border costs resulting from Brexit: motivation is massive reduction in trade between Britain and the EU since the referendum despite the delay in actual physical trade restrictions. Hypothesis: trade restrictions that appear relatively small have surprisingly large effects on trade flows.

2. Estimating effect of Brexit on UK labor market: basically, a follow up to some of the pre-referendum research on the effects of immigration from the EU on UK wages. Possible differential effects on low and high wage sectors. Motivation: One of major reasons for leaving EU was the hypothesized negative effect of cheap EU labor on the lower end of the UK wage distribution (although this effect appears to have been small, even prior to Brexit).

    - Is LFS survey data available?

3. Estimating the propagation of productivity shocks through a production network, and how it can be amplified by financial frictions. Production sectors are connected by input-ouput linkages. They are also connected by financial linkages.

4. Can hysteresis (permanent demand shocks) explain differential unemployment rates in Europe? Use similar method to [Furlanetto et al. (2021)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2021059pap.pdf), but using European data and with a panel aspect to get cross country comparisons.

5. Estimating consumption response to CAREs act. Probably been done already, but could be a useful source of information on MPCs and possibly even intertemporal MPCs because the policy was announced in advance (would depend on if people were aware and believed the policy would actually follow through).

6. How much more flexible are prices now that a significant share of purchases happen through online retailers?
